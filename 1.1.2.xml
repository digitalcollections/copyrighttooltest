# You probably can use the audio file, but may need to check...
	
If you created the audio file as part of your employment at GCU, and it is unreleased, then GCU owns the copyright. GCU are happy for you to use the file as part of their contribution to academia. 

If you created the audio file in your own time using your own equipment, and it is unpublished, then you hold the copyright. This means that you can use or share it freely. You should consider what your overall aim is with the piece. If you want to publish or release it at a later date, production companies may not view it favourably if it has appeared on the open web.  

If you want to share the audio file widely, then you can make it available as an [Open Educational Resource] (http://www.gcu.ac.uk/library/servicesforstaff/copyright/copyrightglossary) (OER) and assign a [Creative Commons] (http://www.gcu.ac.uk/library/servicesforstaff/copyright/copyrightglossary)  (CC) licence which allows you to specify exactly what uses you will allow to be made of your creation.

If you wrote the audio file while in the employ of another university or employer, then you should check with them to clarify who holds the copyright and what uses they allow you to make of it.If you would like further help, contact the copyright team on
