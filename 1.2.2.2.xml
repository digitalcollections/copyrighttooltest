# We recommend you use BoB to provide UK access.
	
GCU has an [Educational Recording Agency] (https://www.gcu.ac.uk/library/servicesforstaff/copyright/copyrightglossary/) (ERA) licence which allows the recording and use of UK radio broadcasts for educational purposes. You can read more about the terms of the licence at the ERA [FAQs page] (https://era.org.uk/the-licence/frequently-asked-questions/). 

We recommend you use the [Box of Broadcasts] (https://www.gcu.ac.uk/library/servicesforstaff/copyright/copyrightglossary/)  (BoB) service as this will provide you with an easy link to a digital recording. However, these items are available to users in the UK only as access is geographically restricted using IP login. More about BoB and some quickstart guides are available on our [web page] (https://www.gcu.ac.uk/library/servicesforstaff/recordtvprogrammes/).
