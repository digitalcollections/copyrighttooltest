Uploading recordings of UK free-to-air radio programmes to an open website is not covered by either our [Educational Recording Agency] (https://era.org.uk/the-licence/the-era-license/) (ERA) licence or the educational exceptions to the copyright act. (You can read more about the terms of the licence at the ERA [FAQs page] (https://era.org.uk/the-licence/frequently-asked-questions/).) 

You should look for an alternative resource. A quick way to find reusable audio files is to use a [Google advanced search] (https://www.google.co.uk/advanced_search) or a [Creative Commons (CC) search] (https://search.creativecommons.org/). The CC search allows you to specify the websites to search while the Google advanced search allows you to search by licence type.
