If you want to use a file that you have created, but which has been released elsewhere, you can upload it to edShare with access restricted by login as this may be covered by an educational exception to copyright law. This allows the use of an item for teaching purposes, provided that the source of the material is credited, the use of the material is fair, and that the use is truly to illustrate the point being made (playing sound recordings for shock value or to make the session more engaging does not qualify under the exceptions for education). A standard citation format for use with multimedia items is:
	
Type of content: Title by Author. Link (Licence)
